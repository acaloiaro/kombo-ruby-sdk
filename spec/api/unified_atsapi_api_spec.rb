  # Get application stages
  # Get all application stages available in the ATS.  &lt;Warning&gt;   **This endpoint is deprecated!**    Get all application stages available in the ATS. This is deprecated because most ATS systems have separate sets of stages for each job. We&#39;d recommend using the &#x60;stages&#x60; property from the [GET Jobs endpoint](/ats/v1/get-jobs) instead.  **Important**: Using global stages can cause \&quot;Stage not found\&quot; errors when moving applications, especially with systems like Workable that have job-specific stages.  [Moving Applications Guide](/ats/implementation-guide/moving-and-rejecting-candidates). &lt;/Warning&gt;  Top level filters use AND, while individual filters use OR if they accept multiple arguments. That means filters will be resolved like this: &#x60;(id IN ids) AND (remote_id IN remote_ids)&#x60;

  # Get users
  # Retrieve all users.  Top level filters use AND, while individual filters use OR if they accept multiple arguments. That means filters will be resolved like this: &#x60;(id IN ids) AND (remote_id IN remote_ids)&#x60;

  # @option opts [String] :cursor An optional cursor string used for pagination. This can be retrieved from the &#x60;next&#x60; property of the previous page response.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size The number of results to return per page. Maximum is 250.
  # @option opts [Time] :updated_after Filter the entries based on the modification date in format &#x60;YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ&#x60;. Returns records where either the record itself **OR** its nested data has been updated since this timestamp, even if the record&#39;s own &#x60;changed_at&#x60; field remains unchanged.  If you want to track entry deletion, also set the &#x60;include_deleted&#x3D;true&#x60; query parameter, because otherwise, deleted entries will be hidden.
