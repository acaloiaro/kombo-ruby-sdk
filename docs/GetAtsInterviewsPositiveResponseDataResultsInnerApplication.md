# Kombo::GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerApplication

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **outcome** | **String** | Parsed status of the application. If Kombo identifies that the application was accepted and the candidate hired, it will be &#x60;HIRED&#x60;. If the application was rejected or the candidate declined, it will be &#x60;DECLINED&#x60;. If the application is still in process, it will be &#x60;PENDING&#x60;. Kombo will always try to deliver this information as reliably as possible. |  |
| **rejection_reason_name** | **String** | Reason for the rejection of the candidate. |  |
| **candidate** | [**GetAtsOffersPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerApplicationCandidate**](GetAtsOffersPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerApplicationCandidate.md) |  |  |
