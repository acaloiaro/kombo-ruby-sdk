# Kombo::GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInner

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **title** | **String** | The title of the interview. |  |
| **starting_at** | **Time** | The start time of the interview. |  |
| **ending_at** | **Time** | The end time of the interview. |  |
| **location** | [**GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerInterviewsInnerLocation**](GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerInterviewsInnerLocation.md) |  | [optional] |
| **application_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the application this interview belongs to. The ID can be used to retrieve the application from the &#x60;get applications&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **stage_id** | **String** | If a system specifies to which stage this interview belongs to, this field will be the Kombo ID of the application stage. The ID can be used to retrieve the stage from the &#x60;get application stages&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **canceled** | **Boolean** | Whether the interview was canceled or not. If we have no information, this field will be &#x60;null&#x60;. |  |
| **remote_created_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was created in the remote system. |  |
| **remote_updated_at** | **Time** | A timestamp retrieved from the remote system, describing when the resource was last updated. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **users** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerUsersInner&gt;**](GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerUsersInner.md) |  |  |
| **application** | [**GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerApplication**](GetAtsInterviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerApplication.md) |  |  |
