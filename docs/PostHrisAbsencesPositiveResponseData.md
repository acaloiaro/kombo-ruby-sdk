# Kombo::PostHrisAbsencesPositiveResponseData

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **employee_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the employee to which the absence belongs to. The ID can be used to retrieve the employee from the &#x60;get employees&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **approver_id** | **String** | **(⚠️ Deprecated - We won&#39;t increase coverage for this feature)** The Kombo ID of the employee who is responsible for approving this absence. |  |
| **start_date** | [**Null**](Null.md) | The date this absence starts in the &#x60;yyyy-MM-dd&#x60; format. |  |
| **end_date** | [**Null**](Null.md) | The date this absence ends in the &#x60;yyyy-MM-dd&#x60; format. |  |
| **start_half_day** | **Boolean** | &#x60;true&#x60; if the absence starts in the middle of the day, &#x60;false&#x60; if not, and &#x60;null&#x60; if the absence type doesn&#39;t support half-day absences. For multi-day absences, this only applies to the first day of the absence. |  |
| **end_half_day** | **Boolean** | &#x60;true&#x60; if the absence ends in the middle of the day, &#x60;false&#x60; if not, and &#x60;null&#x60; if the absence type doesn&#39;t support half-day absences. For multi-day absences, this only applies to the last day of the absence. |  |
| **start_time** | [**Null**](Null.md) | The time at which this absence starts. Follows the format &#x60;HH:mm:ss&#x60; (e.g., &#x60;14:45:15&#x60;). |  |
| **end_time** | [**Null**](Null.md) | The time at which this absence ends. Follows the format &#x60;HH:mm:ss&#x60; (e.g., &#x60;14:45:15&#x60;). |  |
| **amount** | **Float** | The amount of time this absence takes. |  |
| **unit** | **String** | The unit of time for this absence. Can be &#x60;HOURS&#x60; or &#x60;DAYS&#x60;. |  |
| **status** | [**GetHrisAbsencesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStatus**](GetHrisAbsencesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStatus.md) |  | [optional] |
| **employee_note** | **String** | A note the employee has added to this absence. |  |
| **type_id** | **String** | The Kombo absence type ID of this absence. |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
