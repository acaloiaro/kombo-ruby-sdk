| Name | Type | Description | Notes |

| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |

The usual flow of statuses is as follows: &#x60;DRAFT&#x60; -&gt; &#x60;APPROVED&#x60; -&gt; &#x60;SENT&#x60; -&gt; &#x60;ACCEPTED&#x60; or &#x60;DECLINED&#x60;.  Please note that not all systems will expose all statuses. For example, most systems do not include the &#x60;APPROVED&#x60; status  - &#x60;ACCEPTED&#x60;: The offer was accepted by the candidate. - &#x60;DECLINED&#x60;: The offer was declined by the candidate. - &#x60;SENT&#x60;: The offer was sent to the candidate. - &#x60;APPROVED&#x60;: The draft was approved. - &#x60;DRAFT&#x60;: The offer is a draft and has not yet been sent to the candidate. - &#x60;ABANDONED&#x60;: The offer has expired or is no longer valid and should not be considered.  |  |
