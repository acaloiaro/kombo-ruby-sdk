# Kombo::PostAtsJobsJobIdApplicationsPositiveResponseDataCandidate

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **first_name** | **String** | First name of the candidate. |  |
| **last_name** | **String** | Last name of the candidate. |  |
| **company** | **String** | The current company of the candidate. |  |
| **title** | **String** | The current job title of the candidate. |  |
| **confidential** | **Boolean** | Whether the candidate’s profile is confidential in the ATS. |  |
| **source** | **String** | The hiring source of the candidate. If you&#39;re a job board or recruiting service, you can use this to validate which candidates applied through your service and ensure that the correct referral compensation is paid out. |  |
| **phone_numbers** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidatePhoneNumbersInner&gt;**](GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidatePhoneNumbersInner.md) | A list of phone numbers of the candidate. | [optional] |
| **email_addresses** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateEmailAddressesInner&gt;**](GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateEmailAddressesInner.md) | A list of email addresses of the candidate with an optional type. If an email address is invalid, it will be filtered out. | [optional] |
| **social_media** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateSocialMediaInner&gt;**](GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateSocialMediaInner.md) | List of social media accounts of the candidate. | [optional] |
| **location** | [**GetAtsCandidatesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerLocation**](GetAtsCandidatesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerLocation.md) |  | [optional] |
| **custom_fields** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | A key-value store of fields not covered by the schema. [Read more](/custom-fields) |  |
| **integration_fields** | [**Array&lt;GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner&gt;**](GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner.md) | An array of selected passthrough integration fields. [Read more](/integration-fields) |  |
| **remote_url** | **String** | URL to the candidate profile in the source ATS system. When embedding this in your system, please consider that not for all ATS a dedicated candidate profile URL is available, so you might need to fall back to the application URL. |  |
| **remote_created_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was created in the remote system. |  |
| **remote_updated_at** | **Time** | A timestamp retrieved from the remote system, describing when the resource was last updated. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **tags** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateTagsInner&gt;**](GetAtsApplicationsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerCandidateTagsInner.md) |  |  |
