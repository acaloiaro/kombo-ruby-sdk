# Kombo::GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerJobPostingsInner

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **title** | **String** | The job posting’s title. |  |
| **description_html** | **String** | The job posting’s description in HTML format. |  |
| **status** | **String** | The job posting’s current status. |  |
| **visibility** | **String** |  |  |
| **url** | **String** | The public URL to the job posting on the ATS platform. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
