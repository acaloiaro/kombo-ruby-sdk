# Kombo::GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInner

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **name** | **String** | Title of the job. |  |
| **job_code** | **String** | The human readable job code. Some systems expose this as the Requisition Code/ID. |  |
| **description** | **String** | Description of the job. This field is usually returned as HTML. |  |
| **confidential** | **Boolean** | **(⚠️ Deprecated)** It makes more sense to store the visibility of a job in an enum. Therefore, we introduced the &#x60;visibility&#x60; enum on jobs. |  |
| **weekly_hours** | **Float** | The number of hours per week an employee is expected to work. |  |
| **employment_type** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerEmploymentType**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerEmploymentType.md) |  | [optional] |
| **status** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStatus**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStatus.md) |  | [optional] |
| **visibility** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerVisibility**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerVisibility.md) |  | [optional] |
| **category** | **String** | The category of the job (often the job industry). The original string is passed through, for example \&quot;Information Technology\&quot;, \&quot;Quality Assurance\&quot;, \&quot;Marketing\&quot;. |  |
| **department** | **String** | The internal department or team the job belongs to. The original string is passed through, for example \&quot;IT/Operations\&quot;, \&quot;Engineering - Platform\&quot;, \&quot;Customer Success\&quot;. |  |
| **post_url** | **String** | The public job posting URL of the ATS itself. This can be used by external job boards to redirect applicants. |  |
| **experience_level** | **String** | The role&#39;s seniority or experience level. The original string is passed through, for example \&quot;Mid-Senior Level\&quot;, \&quot;5+ years\&quot;, \&quot;Associate\&quot;, \&quot;IC3\&quot;. |  |
| **remote_work_status** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerRemoteWorkStatus**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerRemoteWorkStatus.md) |  | [optional] |
| **salary_amount** | **Float** | The salary amount in the given currency. |  |
| **salary_amount_from** | **Float** | The lower bound of the salary range. |  |
| **salary_amount_to** | **Float** | The upper bound of the salary range. |  |
| **salary_currency** | **String** | Salary currency usually returned in [ISO 4217 currency codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html). |  |
| **salary_period** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerSalaryPeriod**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerSalaryPeriod.md) |  | [optional] |
| **location** | [**GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerLocation**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerLocation.md) |  | [optional] |
| **custom_fields** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | A key-value store of fields not covered by the schema. [Read more](/custom-fields) |  |
| **integration_fields** | [**Array&lt;GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner&gt;**](GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner.md) | An array of selected passthrough integration fields. [Read more](/integration-fields) |  |
| **remote_url** | **String** | URL to the job posting in the source ATS system. |  |
| **opened_at** | **Time** | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ |  |
| **closed_at** | **Time** | The date the job closed or is scheduled to close. A future value typically indicates the job remains open for applications until that date.  Please use the &#x60;status&#x60; and &#x60;visibility&#x60; fields to determine if a job can be published. |  |
| **remote_created_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was created in the remote system. |  |
| **remote_updated_at** | **Time** | A timestamp retrieved from the remote system, describing when the resource was last updated. |  |
| **contact_id** | **String** | **(⚠️ Deprecated)** The user ID of the contact person for this job. We strongly recommend using the new &#x60;hiring_team&#x60; property instead as it provides more complete and accurate information about the ATS users connected to a job. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **stages** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStagesInner&gt;**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerStagesInner.md) | Application stages a candidate can be in for this particular job.  |  |
| **screening_questions** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerScreeningQuestionsInner&gt;**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerScreeningQuestionsInner.md) |  |  |
| **job_postings** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerJobPostingsInner&gt;**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerJobPostingsInner.md) |  |  |
| **hiring_team** | [**Array&lt;GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerHiringTeamInner&gt;**](GetAtsJobsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerHiringTeamInner.md) | The hiring team allows you to sync users into your system who can access the job and its applications. |  |
