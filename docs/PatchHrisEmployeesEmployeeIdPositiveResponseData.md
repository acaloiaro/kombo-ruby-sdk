## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |

| **nationality** | **String** | The employee’s nationality. |  |
| **display_full_name** | **String** | The employee’s full name, including any middle names. Not all HR systems provide an explicit display name, so we recommend falling back to &#x60;first_name&#x60; and &#x60;last_name&#x60;. |  |
| **job_title** | **String** | The employee’s job title. |  |

| **weekly_hours** | **Float** | The employee’s weekly working hours. |  |
| **avatar** | **String** | URL to the employee’s avatar. This is either the raw URL from the HR system (in cases where it can be requested without short-lived authentication) _or_ a URL to a temporarily cached version of the file hosted by Kombo. Kombo will delete the cached file after its deletion in the source system. |  |
| **work_location_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the employee’s work location. The ID can be used to retrieve the work location from the &#x60;get work locations&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **legal_entity_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the employee’s legal entity. The ID can be used to retrieve the legal entity from the &#x60;get legal entities&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **manager_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the employee’s manager. The ID can be used to retrieve the manager from the &#x60;get employees&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **home_address** | [**GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerHomeAddress**](GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerHomeAddress.md) |  | [optional] |
| **bank_accounts** | [**Array&lt;GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerBankAccountsInner&gt;**](GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerBankAccountsInner.md) | The employee’s bank accounts. | [optional] |

| **termination_date** | **Time** | The date when the employment ends. Can be in the past or future. |  |
| **remote_created_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was created in the remote system. |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
