# Kombo::GetHrisTimesheetsPositiveResponseDataResultsInner

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **employee_id** | **String** | The Kombo ID of the employee to which the timesheet belongs. The ID can be used to retrieve the employee from the &#x60;get employees&#x60; endpoint. |  |
| **started_at** | **Time** | Start time of the shift, converted into UTC time zone. |  |
| **ended_at** | **Time** | End time of the shift, converted into UTC time zone. |  |
| **timezone** | **String** | The ISO 8601 numeric UTC offset of the timesheet location in the format ±HH:MM (e.g., \&quot;+02:00\&quot;, \&quot;-05:30\&quot;). If null, the original offset information was not available. You can use this to display the right timezone for the timesheet in the UI. |  |
| **payable_hours** | **Float** | Payable hours including grace periods - only if available in the HRIS. Won&#39;t be calculated through Kombo. |  |
| **unpaid_break_minutes** | **Float** | Unpaid break in minutes - will be from the HRIS or calculated by Kombo if we have concrete unpaid break times. |  |
| **breaks** | [**Array&lt;GetHrisTimesheetsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerBreaksInner&gt;**](GetHrisTimesheetsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerBreaksInner.md) | Concrete times of the breaks. | [optional] |
| **approval_status** | **String** | Approval status of the shift. Can be PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, or null. |  |
| **approved_at** | **Time** | The time when the shift was approved. |  |
| **comment** | **String** | Comment on the shift. |  |
| **custom_fields** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | A key-value store of fields not covered by the schema. [Read more](/custom-fields) |  |
| **integration_fields** | [**Array&lt;GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner&gt;**](GetHrisEmployeesPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerIntegrationFieldsInner.md) | An array of selected passthrough integration fields. [Read more](/integration-fields) |  |
| **changed_at** | **Time** | The timestamp when this specific record was last modified. This field only updates when properties directly on this record change, NOT when related or nested models change. For filtering that considers nested data changes, use the &#x60;updated_after&#x60; parameter which will return records when either the record itself OR its related models have been updated. |  |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
| **remote_data** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Includes the data fetched from the remote system. Please be aware that including this in you scope config might violate other scopes that are set.  Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the data from as the top level key. For example, it could look like: &#x60;{ \&quot;/companies\&quot;: { ... }}&#x60;  This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if you need it. |  |
