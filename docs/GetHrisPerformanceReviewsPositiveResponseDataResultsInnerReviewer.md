# Kombo::GetHrisPerformanceReviewsPositiveResponseDataResultsInnerReviewer

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | The globally unique ID of this object generated by Kombo. We recommend using this as a stable primary key for syncing. |  |
| **remote_id** | **String** | The raw ID of the object in the remote system. We don&#39;t recommend using this as a primary key on your side as it might sometimes be compromised of multiple identifiers if a system doesn&#39;t provide a clear primary key. |  |
| **first_name** | **String** | The employee’s first name. |  |
| **last_name** | **String** | The employee’s last name. |  |
| **display_full_name** | **String** | The employee’s full name, including any middle names. Not all HR systems provide an explicit display name, so we recommend falling back to &#x60;first_name&#x60; and &#x60;last_name&#x60;. |  |
| **work_email** | **String** | The employee’s work email address. If the email address is invalid, we will set this to &#x60;null&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **remote_deleted_at** | **Time** | The date and time the object was deleted in the remote system. Objects are automatically marked as deleted when Kombo can&#39;t retrieve them from the remote system anymore. Kombo will also anonymize entries 14 days after they disappear. |  |
